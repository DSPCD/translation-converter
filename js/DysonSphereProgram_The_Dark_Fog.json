  "base_地中海介绍_3": "A Mariterra type planet is where the COSMO (Coalition of Stellar Management Organizations) chose Icarus to launch the Dyson Sphere Program.\r\nCOSMO's considerations are extensive and thorough; it is a well known fact that these planets are extremely rare within the universe. A glimpse from space reveals that Mariterra planets have a very similar landscape and climate to that of our home planet, which not only relieves Icarus of its homesickness, but also provides a familiar environment for it to get into the swing of its workflow.\r\nThe planets’ fragmented continental shelves may lead to more diverse civilizations of local intelligent life. Relatively narrower oceans may facilitate their ability to communicate, while denser seismic zones may make them more inclined to cooperate with each other. Upon the arrival of our mecha, we will probably encounter a class I-II civilization that is already reasonably developed. If we can gain their cooperation, it will save Icarus from many of the most tedious processes involved in the early development of an industrial system, and unify the local stellar system’s resources when progressing the Dyson Sphere program.\r\nSparing a thought for the borderline unimaginable situation that \"there is no indigenous civilization on a Mariterra planet\", COSMO is working on it and promises to respond within 15 working days after the plan is finalized.",
  "base_红石介绍_3": "The planet is very similar to that of a Mariterra due to a similar nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and broken continental shelf. The difference between them; however, is the very different ecosystem here, as the sunlight on this Crimsonis planet lies so far left on the red spectrum that the flora here has evolved some kind of red pigment to avoid it from burning through their cells.\r\nDespite being brought under control in time, an observatory has detected stress-secreted alkaloids in a common mushroom on the planet's continent, far from the crisis area. This may indicate that all fungi on this Crimsonis planet are interlinked by mycelium deep underground, or that they are all different strains that have evolved from the same parent.",
  "base_海洋丛林介绍_3": "Tropicana planets have 60 to 70 percent of their surface covered by bodies of water, nurturing lush rainforests within the continents.\r\nThese biomes see continuous rainfall near the equator, while lower latitudes have distinct wet and dry seasons as the planet rotates.\r\nTropicanas retain a huge biomass and any local industrial development will shake this large, complex, yet fragile ecosystem to its core, but what’s more important - nature, or progress?",
  "base_草原介绍_3": "A characteristic of Prairiea Planets is their dense flora, with up to 95 percent of surface coverage consisting of herbaceous plants, while the remaining area consists of large rivers and lakes of water.\r\nThere are many different theories about how Prairiea planets have come to be; the most generally accepted view is that the early formation of the stellar system can be accredited to the overall small number of comets, making the number of comet impacts low. Ice-laden comets are the planets’ main source of water, and so the average precipitation levels recorded on Prairiea planets are insufficient to support complex biospheres.\r\nOther hypotheses such as \"solar wind stripping\" and \"soil formation process obstruction\" have also been suggested. However, the end result is the same: these lush planets are suitable for the extensive development of organic industry.",
  "base_热带草原介绍_3": "Unlike Prairiea planets, the rocky mountains on Savanna planets prevent water vapor in the form of rain clouds from being effectively transported inland, resulting in a highly uneven distribution of local rainfall.\r\nThere are many different theories about how Prairiea planets have come to be. Some scholars believe that due to a scarcity of magnesium and iron in the primordial nebula of the stellar system where these planets were formed, the crust of Prairiea planets once had a high quartz content,therefore creating a slow soil formation process due to its tough exterior. The end result was a thin soil layer, and so herbaceous plants with shallow root systems have become the dominant species on these planets.\r\nOther hypotheses such as \"solar wind stripping\" and \"soil formation process obstruction\" have also been suggested. However, the end result is the same: this planet is suitable for the extensive development of organic industry.",
  "base_樱林海介绍_3": "Up to 70% of the surface of Sakura Ocean planets are covered by water, nurturing lush rainforests across the continents.\r\nFamous for its endless sea of flowers, distinctive seasons and mild climate, this type of planet became a hotspot for real estate developers, attracting tourists to visit the Cherry Groves and putting the planet on the map.\r\nAccording to past data, the fertility rate of a population settled on a Sakura Ocean planet tended to be about 3 thousandths higher than other planets, with some studies believing that this may be related to a pheromone secreted by local flora during the blossoming period.",
  "base_水世界介绍_3": "True to their name, oceans make up more than 90 percent of the surface of Aquaticas, while any available land consists of small scattered islands.\r\nRegarding the origin of seawater on these planets, it is generally believed that Aquaticas were initially formed within frozen space and thus accumulated a large amount of ice, which later entered the habitable zone under the gravitational perturbation of other celestial bodies; the ice then melted into the vast oceans we now know due to natural sunlight.\r\nWhether it is a hot spring ecosystems created by on chemo-energetic autotrophic bacteria in submarine volcanoes or the cyanobacteria chasing warm ocean currents, the unique ecology of Aquaticas always gives rise to a spectrum of eye-catching organisms. Under the high pressure of constant volcanic movement on the ocean floor, these planets have formed rich veins of Stalagmite Crystal. However, building any kind of factory on a planet scarce in land presents its own challenges.",
  "base_潘多拉沼泽介绍A_3": "The surface of a Pandora Swamp planet is almost entirely devoid of water; however, this does not mean that it has an arid climate - on the contrary, it is rather humid.\r\nAlmost all of the free-flowing water on Pandora Swamps is stored within local organisms which have evolved around a hollow, tube-like plant with a maximum internal diameter of more than a dozen meters to transfer water across the basin. Academic study states that if the planet's biosphere is considered a civilization, then \"their\" use of matter has reached a civilization level of 0.79.",
  "base_潘多拉沼泽介绍B_3": "The surface of a Pandora Swamp planet is almost entirely covered by a dense carpet of jungle and fungus; these organisms almost \"actively\" affect the climate of the entire planet, with studies revealing that some forests are able to control the direction of each monsoon by simply adjusting the angle of leaf coverage.\r\nThe plants on Pandora Swamp planets have developed ultra-efficient photosynthetic pathways, using 65% of the energy the planet receives from stellar radiation for malic acid synthesis. Academic study states that if the planet's biosphere is considered a civilization, then \"their\" use of matter has reached a civilization level of 0.79.",
  "base_熔岩介绍_3": "A Lava planet’s restless core brings extreme geological activity, with its perennially erupting volcanos bringing incessant lava flow and smog. Its surface is not so much land as it is slag that rises from the molten rock.\r\nAll planets go through this process in the early stages of their evolution, and then gradually emerge with a stable crust as the radioactive material inside the planet ends its decay and the mantle cools. If planets come too close to a star; however, they remain molten before being swallowed up by the larger body.\r\nRushing magma dissolves materials from deep within the mantle forming rich metal and mineral resources, while the stable magma flow offers convenient access to geothermal energy.",
  "base_火山灰介绍_3": "The surface of Sulfuria planets has long since cooled, but a restless interior brings active geological movements. The biome’s volcanoes and seismic zones are active year-round, with gases from the magma shaping the planet's atmosphere.\r\nThe atmosphere of these planets is filled with acidic gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, which dissolve in bodies of water to form lakes of sulfuric acid. While this simplifies the extraction of some basic chemical materials, maintenance may bring a new challenge for Icarus.\r\nActive volcanoes may bring mineral resources from deep underground to the surface, but the volcanic ash that fills the area blocks out the sunlight, while the fumes make the climate stifling and an overall unpleasant place to live.",
  "base_冰原冻土介绍A_3": "Glacieon planets are composed mainly of ice and rock. Due to tidal action and an uncooled core, many of these icy planets have vast, deep saltwater oceans beneath their thick ice shells, which provide the necessary support for its possible origin of life.\r\nThe growth of the ecosystems on these planets is usually stunted due to a lack of stellar irradiation; however, if it satellites a gas giant, a life-bearing Glacieon planet is likely to evolve algae that gain energy by cutting through the magnetic field of the gas giant, thus supporting a flourishing subsurface ecosystem as a first trophic level.",
  "base_冰原冻土介绍B_3": "Glacieon planets are composed mainly of ice and rock. Due to tidal action and an uncooled core, many of these icy planets are dotted with active ice volcanoes. When ice volcanoes erupt, large amounts of water, liquid methane or liquid ammonia (depending on the local geology) are ejected out and then quickly re-condensed into solids by the cold climate.\r\nWhen \"ice magma\" is hot enough, ice volcanoes may also emit smoke consisting of steam, methane, or ammonia. These plumes form spectacular formations and are photolyzed by stellar irradiation, providing the planet with a thin atmosphere composed of pure oxygen or nitrogen.",
  "base_冰原冻土介绍C_3": "Glacieon planets are composed mainly of ice and rock. Although these planets are usually far from stars and do not receive much power from sunlight, some ice sheets are covered by a layer of translucent ice, which causes a greenhouse effect by reflecting sunlight back and forth between the ice layers, melting and cracking it and thus profoundly influencing the planet's topography.\r\nThis phenomenon creates a zigzagging equatorial seismic belt between the tropics on some ice sheets, often causing engineering inconvenience in the past.",
  "base_灰烬冻土介绍_3": "A cold, rocky planet with an atmosphere consisting mainly of nitrogen, its surface is covered with deserts and snow mounds made of dry ice.\r\nThe reason for the dryness of these planets is that they were first formed within the freeze line, and therefore could not be attracted by gravity alone. The water, ammonia and methane that was precipitated from the magma or taken from smaller bodies after the planet took shape escaped from the surface, later reaching higher orbits and becoming disturbed by other celestial bodies where the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere froze into snowflakes at ultra-low temperatures. As a result, nitrogen was left to form cold winds that whip through this empty world.",
  "base_极寒冻土介绍_3": "An Icefrostia planet is composed mainly of ice and rock; the tundra consists of frozen nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. The sublimation of the ice crust on the planet's surface offers the planet a thin layer of atmosphere, and because of its extremely low temperatures, we can use machines and carriers made from dry ice and solid methane, where they are as reliable a raw material as metal ceramics.",
  "base_猩红冰湖介绍_3": "A Maroonfrost planet is composed mainly of ice and rock. The surface of this type of planet is created by hydrocarbon compounds, and its atmosphere uses nitrogen as its main component.\r\nThrough a combination of an ever-changing climate, thunderstorms, and sunlight, the clouds on a Maroonfrost undergo active chemical reactions with certain substances within the lake, thus covering the surface of the planet with an organic reddish-brown soft mud.\r\nThere is a high probability of life on this planet; the observatory has discovered single-celled organisms that seem to possess a different form of genetic combination, which may prove very valuable for research.",
  "base_贫瘠荒漠介绍_3": "A Desolus planet has cooled prematurely because its own mass is too small; devoid of any geological activity, this planet cannot sustain an atmosphere. From space, only a bright highland of ancient crust and a dark sea of basalt condensed by volcanic lava are visible. Because of its thin atmosphere and weak weathering, various small celestial bodies have left craters of various sizes on this Desolus planet.",
  "base_橙晶荒漠介绍_3": "There is an old story about a crashed alien ship that was found with a cargo hold full of pyrite, a shiny stone found all over the Onyxtopia planet. The unlucky alien had apparently taken it for the even rarer gold, and as the fable goes, the greedy traveler was dazzled by the riches and ignored the ship's weight capacity, which ultimately led to its demise.\r\nWhat is more amazing about this planet, however, is its obsidian-like mountains and hills. Researchers believe this was caused during its molten planet phase, when it crashed into an icy planet traveling at about the same speed, causing the planet to cool rapidly. This impact caused material from the core to be thrown onto the surface, which is why it is so iron-rich.\r\nSuch a special environment has created a rarity known as a Grating Crystal. Researchers offered to conduct further experiments to test this theory; however, most of the department had left their jobs by this time to indulge in the virtual world, meaning the application for research funding was ultimately abandoned due to extensive processing delays.",
  "base_戈壁介绍_3": "Most likely due to its active volcanoes, Gobi planets have an extremely dense carbon dioxide atmosphere. The planet's uncontrolled greenhouse effects cause extremely high surface temperatures, evaporating and photolysing any remaining water and thus completely eliminating any chance of life. \r\nProtected by this atmosphere, Gobi planets have both a very low temperature disparity between day and night, and a low surface wind speed, allows geological features from ancient times to remain relatively intact.",
  "base_干旱荒漠介绍A_3": "The surface of a Scorchedia planet is covered by endless desert, and its carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere carries a large amount of sand. Due to the large temperature disparity between day and night, these planets are often gusty, leaving permanent rings of varying shades on the planet.\r\nThere were once mountains on these planets. However, upon the complete formation of the planet these towering peaks were gradually worn away by the wind and the land gradually flattened, eventually leaving only jagged rocks scattered across the desert.",
  "base_干旱荒漠介绍B_3": "The surface of a Scorchedia planet is covered by endless desert, and its carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere carries a large amount of sand. Due to the large temperature disparity between day and night, these planets are often gusty, leaving permanent rings of varying shades on the planet.\r\nIce once existed on this desert planet. However, it sublimated into gas which was gradually photolyzed and escaped into the atmosphere. Rising water vapors during this time caused severe greenhouse effects, leaving distinctive stripes that can still be seen in the desert today.",
  "base_黑石岩滩介绍_3": "Halitum planets have an atmosphere dominated by nitrogen and a surface covered by fine sand and salt, indicating that the planet was once dominated by a large ocean.\r\nA civilization may have existed on the planet. However, the development of these space colonies may have failed for various reasons, and it is likely that settlers watched their home planet's ecosystem die out under stellar heating, orbital perturbations, or runaway greenhouse effects.",
  "base_飓风石林介绍_3": "The surface of a Cyclonius planet is scattered with the fossils of many ancient trees under a thin atmosphere composed mainly of chlorine gas.\r\nIt is widely believed that the planet once possessed a thriving ecosystem until a certain type of algae evolved the ability to metabolize chlorine. The gradually increasing concentration of chlorine gas then poisoned the entire food chain, including the source of the chlorine gas.",
  "base_气巨星介绍1_3": "A Gas Giant is a large planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a core made of ice and rock. Due to the extremely high pressure and temperature of its interior, deep within the atmosphere of the giant is a vast ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen.\r\nThese giants are characterized by year-round strong winds, which carry clouds and large amounts of material in a direction parallel to its latitudes, creating ring-like streaks and bright bands. Winds from different directions often collide, producing vortices and thunderbolts.\r\nBecause of its fluid environment, winds encounter very little resistance and tend to form semi-permanent storm eyes. For civilizations whose parent star is satellited by a Gas Giant, some storm eyes are often older than the civilization itself, occupying a special place in their culture.\r\nThe atmosphere of a Gas Giant is rich in nuclear fuel and other resources, and placing collectors in their orbits provides a steady stream of hydrogen and heavy hydrogen.",
  "base_气巨星介绍2_3": "A Gas Giant is a large planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a core made of ice and rock.

Due to the extremely high pressure and temperature of its interior, deep within the atmosphere of the giant is a vast ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen.\r\nThese giants are characterized by year-round gales, which carry clouds and large amounts of material in a direction parallel to its latitudes, creating ring-like streaks and bright bands. Winds from different directions often collide, creating vortices and thunderbolts.\r\nThe planet was once the smaller star in a binary system - its mass was continuously chipped away by another star until it eventually became unable to sustain nuclear fusion, thus becoming a giant planet.\r\nBecause of its unusual history, the planet's atmosphere contains a considerable amount of heavy hydrogen.\r\n",
  "base_冰巨星介绍6_3": "An Ice Giant planet has a rocky core consisting of mainly of water, methane, and ammonia. The giant's sufficiently large self-gravity allows it to possess an extremely dense atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, but fails to evolve further into a Gas Giant because any nebulosity is blown away by solar winds or used by other planets during formation.\r\nThe ice content of an Ice Giant's atmosphere increases with decreasing altitude, while its icy mantle is in a state of supercritical fluid at very high atmospheric pressure. The Ice Giant has no solid surface on which to land, with only a faint boundary between its atmosphere and icy mantle.\r\nSeasonal changes and weather activity exist on Ice Giants, however, with few clouds, its colors lack variation and the planet almost seems to appear flat.",

The giant's sufficiently large self-gravity allows it to possess an extremely dense atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, but fails to evolve further into a Gas Giant because any nebulosity is blown away by solar winds or used by other planets during formation.\r\nThe ice content of an Ice Giant's atmosphere increases with decreasing altitude, while its icy mantle is in a state of supercritical fluid at very high atmospheric pressure. The Ice Giant has no solid surface on which to land, with only a faint boundary between its atmosphere and icy mantle.\r\nThe methane in the giant's atmosphere absorbs red and infrared spectra at wavelengths above 600 nm, giving the planet a bluish color. The haze in the atmosphere appears to be more snow condensed from methane due to its lower temperature, with the presence of methane snow making it reflect a clearer pale blue color.",
  "base_冰巨星介绍8_3": "An Ice Giant planet has a rocky core composed mainly of water, methane, and ammonia (these three hydrogen compounds are often referred to collectively in astronomy as \"ice\"). The giant has a large enough self-gravity to have an extremely dense atmosphere composed of hydrogen and helium, but it did not evolve further into a gas giant because the nebulosity was blown away by the solar wind or used by other planets during its formation.\r\nThe ice content of an Ice Giant's atmosphere increases with decreasing altitude, while its icy mantle is in a state of supercritical fluid at very high atmospheric pressure. The Ice Giant has no solid surface on which to land, with only a faint boundary between its atmosphere and icy mantle.\r\nBeing too close to a star and subject to strong tidal action means that the giant maintains an extremely hot surface temperature. With temperatures exceeding 1000°C, clouds of silicates and iron vapor render the whole planet a vibrant emerald green.",

The Ice Giant has no solid surface on which to land, with only a faint boundary between its atmosphere and icy mantle.\r\nBecause of its relatively young age, this Ice Giant is still relatively hot, causing the ice in its atmosphere to undergo chemical reactions in the presence of ultraviolet light. These reactions result in spectacular colors and patterns that can be observed from space.",

Human beings have used virtual reality to iterate through space and time, created a virtual universe much larger than the real world, and uploaded all human consciousness into it.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the virtual universe requires immense computing capabilities. To achieve this, humans have invented a supercomputer that surrounds the sun and name it \"CentreBrain\", hoping to use its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the virtual Homeland. As the number of consciousnesses continues to grow, CentreBrain's computing power will soon reach its limit. After all, more consciousnesses means more energy supply. For this reason, the COSMO launched a project with the code name \"Dyson Sphere Program\", assigning engineers to the real world to build Dyson Spheres that can supply continuous, stable energy for CentreBrain. As a member of the COSMO and a pioneer of the Dyson Sphere Program, you will use a terminal-controlled mech to embark on an unknown journey. Starting from scratch, you will collect resources, design your production lines and finally achieve full automation. You will establish a giant intergalactic industrial empire from scratch, and carve out your own path to a miracle of the universe, the Dyson Sphere.\r\n\r\nBuilder of the Great Civilization, you are certain to encounter unforeseen challenges that may take you by surprise, for the vast expanse of space is rife with the unexpected and anything can come to pass.
